# WooCommerce Order Lookup Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack React + Express application that provides WooCommerce order lookup functionality. The application allows users to search for orders by email address and displays comprehensive order information including customer details, order totals, and order history.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL support
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store with connect-pg-simple
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution in development

### API Integration
- **WooCommerce REST API**: @woocommerce/woocommerce-rest-api client for primary order data retrieval
- **GoHighLevel API**: Fallback order source when WooCommerce has no results
- **Email Service**: Postmark for transactional email delivery
- **Authentication**: WooCommerce API key-based authentication, GoHighLevel Bearer token authentication
- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas for request/response validation

## Key Components

### Database Schema (`shared/schema.ts`)
- **Users Table**: Basic user management with username/password
- **WooCommerce Types**: Zod schemas for order data validation
- **Drizzle Configuration**: PostgreSQL database connection and migration setup

### API Routes (`server/routes.ts`)
- **Order Lookup Endpoint**: `/api/orders/lookup` - Searches orders by customer email
- **WooCommerce Integration**: Fetches order data from external WooCommerce store
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes

### Frontend Pages
- **Order Lookup Page**: Main interface for searching orders by email
- **Results Display**: Shows order summaries, totals, and detailed order information
- **Error States**: Handles no orders found and API error scenarios

### UI Component System
- **shadcn/ui Components**: Pre-built accessible components (Button, Card, Form, etc.)
- **Custom Components**: CodeBlock for JSON display, specialized form components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Customer enters email address in search form
2. **Form Validation**: React Hook Form validates input using Zod schema
3. **API Request**: TanStack Query sends POST request to `/api/orders/lookup`
4. **Primary Query**: Backend fetches orders from WooCommerce REST API
5. **Fallback Query**: If no WooCommerce orders found, searches GoHighLevel API
6. **Data Processing**: Order data is validated, normalized to WooCommerce format, and total values calculated
7. **Response Handling**: Frontend displays results or error messages
8. **State Management**: Query results cached by TanStack Query

## External Dependencies

### WooCommerce Integration
- **API Endpoint**: Configurable WooCommerce store URL
- **Authentication**: Consumer Key and Consumer Secret
- **API Version**: WooCommerce REST API v3
- **Rate Limiting**: Handled by WooCommerce API limits

### Database Services
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Connection Pooling**: Built-in connection management
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management

### Development Tools
- **Replit Integration**: Configured for Replit development environment
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Vite HMR for fast development
- **Error Overlay**: Replit runtime error modal for debugging

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Assets**: Static files served from built frontend

### Production Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL connection
  - `WOOCOMMERCE_STORE_URL` for WooCommerce API endpoint
  - `WOOCOMMERCE_CONSUMER_KEY` and `WOOCOMMERCE_CONSUMER_SECRET` for API auth
- **Port Configuration**: Application runs on port 5000
- **Auto-scaling**: Configured for Replit autoscale deployment

### Development Setup
- **Development Server**: Concurrent frontend (Vite) and backend (tsx) processes
- **Database Migrations**: `npm run db:push` applies schema changes
- **Type Checking**: `npm run check` validates TypeScript

## Recent Changes
- January 30, 2025: Extended price-based product name mapping to GHL orders with generic "Order" format - system now applies proper product names (Fast-Start, Channel Brand Kit, etc.) to post-July 8th orders instead of showing raw Stripe descriptions like "- Order 32168 - 1 click upsell: 28268"
- January 26, 2025: Successfully implemented $197 product differentiation using WooCommerce line item names and upsell ID detection (23024 = Income Stream Bundle) - system now correctly distinguishes between "Income Stream Bundle" and "7-Figure Launchpad" for both WordPress and GoHighLevel orders
- January 26, 2025: Fixed WP order product names by implementing price-based mapping for all WordPress orders - $27="Fast-Start", $47="Endless Video Ideas", $74="Fast-Start + Endless Video Ideas", $97="Channel Brand Kit", $147/$197="7-Figure Launchpad", $297="7-Figure Launchpad + The $10k Launch Formula"
- January 30, 2025: Fixed $197 product differentiation by correcting WooCommerce matching logic - system now prioritizes WooCommerce line item matching over date-based classification, ensuring orders with WooCommerce data (like "Fast-start - Income Stream Bundle") are correctly identified as WordPress orders regardless of date
- January 26, 2025: Business rule clarification: Orders before July 8th, 2025 are definitively WordPress orders; orders after this date can be either WordPress (if WooCommerce data exists) or GoHighLevel orders
- January 26, 2025: Fixed critical duplicate order issue by filtering failed Stripe transactions and ensuring exactly one product per successful Stripe transaction 
- January 26, 2025: Fixed Zod schema validation issue for GHL contacts with null lastName values by adding .nullable() support - eliminates validation errors that prevented proper product name mapping
- January 26, 2025: Fixed critical product name mapping issues by implementing smart field selection logic - for GHL contacts, system now uses description field instead of generic product_name field, eliminating "Unknown Product" errors for recent customers
